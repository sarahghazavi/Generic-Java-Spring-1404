# Generic Search Engine in Java - Spring 1404

**Simplified Search Engine Project Using Java Generics**

## 📌 Overview

This project is a academic project developed as part of our coursework on **Java Generics** during Spring 1404. The aim was to explore and implement generic programming principles in a real-world scenario. We chose to design a **simplified version of a web browser-based search engine**, using JSON files as the underlying dataset.

## 🚀 Features

* Uses **Java Generics** to build a flexible and type-safe search engine architecture.
* Mimics real browser behavior with:

  * Multiple **browsers** (e.g., Chrome, Firefox)
  * Each browser accessing multiple **websites**
  * Each website composed of several **JSON files** simulating web pages
* Accepts a **question** as input, extracts its **topic**, and searches through the data to return relevant answers.
* Includes a robust **test class** to verify core functionality and behavior.


## 🧪 How to Run

1. Clone the repository
2. Make sure Java 17+ is installed
3. Load the project in your favorite IDE (e.g., IntelliJ or Eclipse)
4. Run `SearchEngineTest` to validate functionality

## 🔧 Technologies Used

* Java 17
* JSON (Gson / Jackson parsing)
* JUnit (for testing)

## 👥 Authors

* Sara Ghazavi
